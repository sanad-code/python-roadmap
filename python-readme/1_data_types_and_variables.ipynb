    "  - This is not the case in other programming languages like C, C++, Java, ... where the size of the integer is fixed.\n",
    "  - Values in python are immutable, you can't change the value of an integer. `x = 10` will create a new integer object with the value 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Float `float`:\n",
    "  - Floating-point numbers (1.5, 2.5, 3.5, -4.5, -5.5). Called float because the decimal point can float.\n",
    "  - Values in python are immutable, you can't change the value of a float. `x = 10.5` will create a new float object with the value 10.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Understand the floating representation in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `10.05` is same as `0.1005 * 100` is same as `0.1005 * 10^2` is same as `0.1005E2`. E2 is the exponent of 10.\n",
    "  - This is called `Scientific Notation` or `Exponential Notation`.\n",
    "  - This is not same as e in math, e is a constant value 2.71828.\n",
    "  - `10.05` is same as `1005 / 100` is same as `1005 / 10^2` is same as `1005 * 10^-2` is same as `1005E-2`.\n",
    "  - So multiply by positive exponent will move the decimal point to the right, and multiply by negative exponent will move the decimal point to the left.\n",
    "  - **Equality of floating-point numbers is not always guaranteed due to the way they are stored in memory**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Boolean `bool`:\n",
    "  - Boolean values (True, False). Used in conditional statements.\n",
    "  - Consider it as asking a question, the answer is either True (Yes/Right) or False(No/Wrong).\n",
    "  - True is equal to 1, False is equal to 0. Thats why you can use True and False in arithmetic operations.\n",
    "  - True and False are capitalized, true and false are not recognized in Python.\n",
